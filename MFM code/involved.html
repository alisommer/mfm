      <h2>Nutrition</h2>
      <p>It is very important that local, fresh produce is available to all people, regardless of income or stability. Currently we have three programs that help low-income people buy healthy foods at our markets. By accepting SNAP (EBT/Food
        Stamps), WIC, and SFMNP vouchers, we aim to decrease the access barriers to fresh healthy food.<p>

      <h2>SNAP (EBT/Food Stamps)</h2>
      <p>Our markets accept SNAP a both markets (Morgantown Farmers' Market and Westover Farmers' Market)
        <br><br>
        Instructions: To use your SNAP, go to the Market Information Booth, tell the staff how much you would like to spend, and they will swipe your EBT card for the amount you request. You're then given your requested amount in $1 plastic tokens.
        <br><br>
        You may not use your tokens to buy non-food items, and no change may be given.
        <br><br>
        If you don't use all your tokens that day, you can save them to use another day at either of our markets.
        <br><br>
        To see if you qualify for EBT/Food Stamps, contact: WV Department of Health & Human Services at (304) 285-3175. For more information or to read the complete USDA SNAP Rules visit www.fns.usda.gov</p>
